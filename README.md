# Learning Platform MVP

This is a minimal learning platform MVP built with Streamlit. It includes user authentication, lesson management, an AI assistant integration (DeepSeek), and basic admin tools.

Quick start:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values.
2. Create a Python venv and install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py` from the repository root.

Note: The DeepSeek service and email sending require valid credentials.
